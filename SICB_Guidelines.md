**DEADLINE: 17 October 2018**
Proposed investigation **(3000 characters maximum, including spaces)** is the most critical part of the proposal.

## Guidelines
- In the first paragraph,
  - state the focal problem clearly and concisely with an explicit research hypothesis that has been set in the context of a broader theory or model.
  - Non-experts will be reading the proposal, so pertinent background information is necessary.
- The second paragraph should describe
  - the proposed research
  - methods
  - experimental design and
  - how the gathered data will relate to previous work in the field,
  - the hypothesis, and
  - broader theory or models.
  - The application should include a brief description of the statistical/analytical approach.
- The third paragraph
  - should present the planned use of the funds.

A well-proofread application indicates professionalism and credibility.
Literature citations should be indicated, but used sparingly.
Include the authors' names and date of publication (e.g., Darwin 1859, rather than a number) in the narrative.

## Evaluation

Each proposal will be evaluated in a number of categories. Reviewers will provide scores for the following questions:
1. Is the background sufficient for you to understand the study and the appropriate literature cited?
2. Is there a clear statement of the primary research goal that links to broader issues in Biology, and has the applicant stated an explicit hypothesis to be tested?
3. Is the experimental design clearly explained, justified, and appropriate given the stated goals and hypothesis?
4. Is the approach for interpretation of the data clearly described and justified?
5. Is the grant well-structured in terms of writing clarity, organization and proofreading?
6. Did you find the proposal creative and interesting or especially likely to address an important issue in Biology?
7. Is the proposed research feasible (e.g., realistic, likely to yield interpretable results)?
8. Are the funds requested reasonable and sufficient to perform the proposed work?
